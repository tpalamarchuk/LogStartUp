# LogStartUp
This program will help you find out who is running your computer

In order for the program to work correctly, you need to put LogStartUp.exe and log.txt in one folder and create a shortcut to the LogStartUp.exe file and put the shortcut in this path: C:\Users\Taras\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu \Programs\Startup in order for the script to run when the PC starts.
